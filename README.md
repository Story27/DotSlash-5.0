Topic : Management of vehicles in large parking areas.

  This project will ask for vehicle number of the owner when they come to any public parking slot.
  Then the program will give them a unique code and this all info will be saved in database.
  then at the time the owner comes to recieve their vehicle to program asks them their vehicle no. 
  and code and checks the database and if the values matches then the owner is given their parking slot,
  else they are given a chance to enter their code, again if its wrong then the program doesn't allow any more attempts.
  Then the program again runs with a new start.
